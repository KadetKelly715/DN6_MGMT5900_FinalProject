        "DIVE Analysis Report: Operational Insights from NYC Taxi Data (2022)\n",
        "Analyst: Grace Bosma, Operational Excellence\n",
        "Date: August 13, 2025\n",
        "Dataset: bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2022\n",
        "Objective: Synthesize data from the Discover, Investigate, Validate and Extend phases to provide a holistic view of operational performance and identify key areas for improvement.\n",
        "Discover: Operational Bottlenecks\n",
        "The first set of results from the refined Discover queries successfully identified key areas and times with the slowest average speeds.\n",
        "Key Findings:\n",
        "Morning Rush is a Major Bottleneck: The lowest average speeds, between 8.3 and 8.9 mph, are consistently found during the morning commute hours of 7 AM to 10 AM. This confirms that traffic congestion during this period is a primary factor affecting service speed.\n",
        "Widespread Bottlenecks: The issue is not confined to one location. Several high-volume pickup locations, including IDs 186 and 236, are experiencing significant slowdowns. The sheer volume of trips (over 60,000 for location ID 186 and over 125,000 for location ID 236) indicates these are critical hubs where delays have a massive impact.\n",
        "Afternoon Slowdowns: A new insight from the refined query shows that low speeds also occur during afternoon hours (12 PM to 3 PM), suggesting that traffic is a persistent daily challenge.\n",
        "Investigate: Revenue Drivers and High-Value Routes\n",
        "The Investigate query results reveal which routes generate the most revenue for the taxi service.\n",
        "Key Findings:\n",
        "Airport Runs are Top Revenue Drivers: The top seven highest-revenue routes all originate from pickup_id 132. This location ID corresponds to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).\n",
        "Consistent High-Value Destinations: The most profitable routes are consistently to drop-off locations 265 and 230. These locations are major hubs, and the high revenue suggests these are long-distance trips.\n",
        "Weekday and Weekend Consistency: These high-value routes are not limited to one day of the week. They consistently generate high revenue on both weekdays and weekends (day_of_week 1, 2, 4, 5, 6), indicating a stable, high-value source of income that is crucial to protect.\n",
        "Validate: Data Quality and Integrity\n",
        "The Validate query successfully identified critical issues in the raw data that would have compromised the entire analysis.\n",
        "Key Findings:\n",
        "Impossible Outliers: The data contained numerous trips with impossible distances (hundreds of thousands of miles) but normal durations. These are clear data entry errors.\n",
        "Validation is Essential: This finding demonstrates the importance of the Validate phase. Without the data cleaning step, any calculation of average speed or revenue per mile would have been completely skewed by these erroneous records.\n",
        "Extend: Areas of Improvement\n",
        "The DIVE analysis has provided a clear picture of operational strengths and weaknesses. The following recommendations are designed to capitalize on strengths and address identified bottlenecks:\n",
        "Prioritize Bottleneck Optimization: Focus resources on analyzing the root cause of slow speeds in high-volume pickup locations like 186, 236, and 237, particularly during rush hours.\n",
        "Protect High-Value Routes: The routes originating from JFK Airport are a critical revenue stream. Monitor performance on these routes closely to ensure reliability and customer satisfaction, as any operational issue here would have a significant financial impact.\n",
        "Implement Automated Data Validation: Moving forward, all analytical queries should include filters to exclude impossible data points, such as those found in the trip_distance column, to ensure the integrity of future reports.\n",
        "Actionable Insights for the \"Extend\" Phase: Use the Extend query to drill down into the demand patterns for high-volume and high-value locations to inform future strategies for AI-driven dispatch or predictive scheduling.\n",
